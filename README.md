## Healthcare Data Analysis - Setup Guide

- This guide provides instructions on how to run the ```data.ipynb``` Jupyter Notebook, which contains code for initializing a MySQL database, creating tables, and inserting data for healthcare data analysis.

### Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL (Make sure the MySQL server is running)
### Setup Steps

#### Install Dependencies:

```pip install pandas mysql-connector-python```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```jupyter notebook data.ipynb```

### Execute Cells:

- Open the data.ipynb notebook in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
- Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by clicking the "Run" button.
- Update Database Connection Details (if needed):

- If you encounter any connection issues, update the database connection details (host, user, password, database) in the code cells where the MySQL connection is established.
Review Results:

- After running all cells, review the results to ensure that tables are created, data is inserted, and queries execute successfully.

### Additional Notes
- If you encounter any errors during the setup, refer to the error messages for guidance. Common issues may include MySQL server not running, incorrect connection details, or missing dependencies.

- Ensure that the data.xlsx file containing healthcare data is present in the same directory as the notebook.

- If you have not set a password for your MySQL root user, leave the password field empty in the code where the MySQL connection is established.
